intro: All the calculations

I'm terrible with math which is why I typically have a calculator open at all times on at least one of my devices. I typically have a pen and paper right next to it to record the results. I've started using my iPad Pro more now for notes but still find myself toggling between the various apps frequently because my brain tends to wipe with every swipe.

It's pretty great to be able to run multiple calculations all in one app. And being able to see the history helps me immensely because I'm typically calculating multiple things that rely on the previous calc.
